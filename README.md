# FCEUX_CheatFinder
Uploading this so I don't lose it. This will create a random game genie code, add it to FCEUX, and optionally load a .fm2 movie and play it. I have it doing a SMB speedrun, so I know if Mario dies before completing the game, something has definitely changed with inputs or the game stages. And you can watch it to see if there are any visual bugs as well.

Some iteresting codes I found with this:

GGAOTA, KVTXNN, and UNKXON: Not sure what all is happening here, but these all mess with the world and graphics. KVTXNN is still playable.
OIKNIL: Bowser is flying in the air and other strange things in 1-1, this crashes almost always though.
YAETZE: All of the enemies are squished and jump around, touching a koopa crashes
VKOUKU: Rains coins from the sky, and most enemies are holding hammers
