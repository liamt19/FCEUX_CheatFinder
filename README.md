# FCEUX_CheatFinder
Uploading this so I don't lose it. This will create a random game genie code, add it to FCEUX, and optionally load a .fm2 movie and play it. I have it doing a SMB speedrun, so I know if Mario dies before completing the game, something has definitely changed with inputs or the game stages. And you can watch it to see if there are any visual bugs as well.
